Brand new bag for Pearl, but I didn't pay for it (Ah-ge-ge-ge-ge)
I don't like spendin' that cash, 'cause I'm tryna savor it (Ayo, Oddwin)
Secret formula, I went and put flavor in (Money)
I do not fuck with no planktons, I can't let no haters in
SpongeBoy (Uh-huh?), get back on the grill (Aye-aye-aye-aye)
The customer's already waitin', they already paid for the meal
Huh, Squidward (Uh-huh?), you been knew the deal (Uh-huh)
Huh, keep watch for that lil' boy that's plottin' on me, I know he gon' steal
He gon' need some four-ply (Four-ply), go get some tissues
Krusty Krew totin' the missiles
Mess with the gang, you get all of these issues (These issues)
I just been countin' this money (Money)
I just laugh to the bank 'cause it's funny (Funny)
Not stealin' no patties, that's chummy (Nope)
I open my doors, they start running (Heh-heh-heh)
It's an event when we open doors, just like the Bubble Bowl (Uh-huh)
The patties are fresh, they are never cold (Uh-huh)
That's somethin' that Plankton would never know (Uh-huh)
That's somethin', for Plankton, I'll never show (Uh-huh)
Chum Bucket's the place that I'll never go (Uh-huh)
This ice on my wrist will forever glow (Uh-huh)
They countin' you out 'cause I ran the pole (Uh-huh-uh-uh)
If he talk on the Krew, I got 13 words to say to him (Bitch)
Ain't no more customers up in this restaurant, you know there's no savin' him (No)
He can barely get by, he eatin' holograms, livin' a lie
We kickin' him out if he step on the spot
They watchin' me flourish, I'm watchin' 'em rot (Damn)
